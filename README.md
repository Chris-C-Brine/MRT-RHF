## Project Purpose
Your library (`@chris-c-brine/mrt-rhf`) aims to simplify the integration between:
- **Material React Table** - A feature-rich table library built on MUI v5
- **React Hook Form** - A performant, flexible form validation library

## Potential Features
Based on typical integration needs, your library could provide:
1. **Form-enabled Table Components** - Pre-configured table components that work with React Hook Form
2. **Custom Cell Editors** - Form field components designed for in-cell editing
3. **Row-level Form Validation** - Apply RHF validation to table rows
4. **Batch Editing Support** - Handle multiple row edits with form validation
5. **Custom Field Adapters** - Components that bridge MRT cells with RHF fields
